# Challenges inspired by Andrei Dumitrescu course: Learn Linux by Doing with 5 Projects
---------------------------------------------------
# Challenge #1
# Create a new user named admin on your Linux system and set its 
# password to 'iloveyou!'. Use John the Ripper to attempt cracking the user’s 
# password using the provided wordlist located at 
# /usr/share/john/password.lst.

# Creating the new user admin
user_999@user999-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$ sudo adduser admin with the given password

[sudo] password for user_999:
Adding user `admin' ...
Adding new group `admin' (1001) ...
Adding new user `admin' (1001) with group `admin' ...
Creating home directory `/home/admin' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
New password:
BAD PASSWORD: The password fails the dictionary check - it is based on a dictionary word
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for admin
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
	Full Name []:
	Room Number []:
	Work Phone []:
	Home Phone []:
	Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n] Y

# password of admin is cracked

---------------------------------------------------

# Challenge #2
# Merge the following three wordlists into a single large file on your 
# Linux system:
# /usr/share/john/password.lst
# /usr/share/dict/american-english
# Remove any duplicate entries from the combined wordlist.
# Determine the total number of unique words in the resulting wordlist.
# Conduct a dictionary attack against the system’s passwords using the 
# merged wordlist.
# While John the Ripper is running, interrupt the cracking session.
# Resume the interrupted cracking session.

# combining two wordlists and checking its line number
