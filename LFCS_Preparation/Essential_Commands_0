sort -duf /finding_files/78_to_sort > ./78sorted
rm ./78sorted

Q6
Display the contents of the archive ./finding_files/89_task_list_archive_content.tar and append the output to ./storing_found/89_list_tar_output.txt

tar tPf ./finding_files/89_task_list_archive_content.tar >> ./storing_found/89_list_tar_output.txt

(Not sure if P is necessary, tPf)

Q7
We briefly covered setuid, setgid, and the sticky bit special permissions. setuid stands for set user id, setgid for set group id.

A7
mkdir tmp_perm/

chmod u+s,g+s,o+t ./tmp_perm/

rm -r tmp_perm

Q8
How do you make searches case-insensitive in vim?

You can verify this in ./finding_files/96_vi_practice_file

A8
/this\c

\c

Q9
How do you index the man pages so they can be searched using apropos?

A9
Use the command:
sudo mandb

Q10
How can you compress the tar archive /opt/SAMPLE0001.tar using bzip2 compression?

A10
bzip2 /opt/SAMPLE0001.tar

Q11
Find files under /finding_files/. Look for a file that is exactly 167 bytes or exactly 188 bytes.

(Should show 2 files)

A11
find ./finding_files/ \( -size 167c -o -size 188c \)

Q12
Find files under /finding_files/. Look for a file that has permission 402 in octal or permission 574 in octal.

(Should show 2 files)

A12
find ./finding_files/ -perm 402 -o -perm 574

Q13
Find files/directories under ./findingFiles that the group can write to, but others cannot read or write to.

Save the list of files/directories, appending it to ./storing_found/exercise_rules.txt.

Then append the date and newline to the same file:
now=$(date)
echo -e $now "\n"

Should find this file:
user_group_all_perm.txt

A13
sudo find ./finding_files -perm -g=w ! -perm /o=rw >> ./storing_found/exercise_rules.txt

now=$(date)
echo -e $now "\n" >> ./storing_found/exercise_rules.txt

Q14
Find all files whose permissions are 0777 in the /var directory.

How many such files did you find?

(Should be 2)

A14
sudo find /var -type f -perm 0777 -print

Q15
Extract the contents of ./finding_files/83_to_extract.tar.gz to the current ./ directory using tar.

A15
tar xf ./finding_files/83_to_extract.tar.gz -C ./

Then remove the created file.


Q16
Execute the script ./finding_files/85_script_with_errors and append all errors only to ./storing_found/85_errors_log.

A16
./finding_files/85_script_with_errors 2>> ./storing_found/85_errors_log

Q17
Create two bzip2 archives from /finding_files/84_file_for_bzip.txt, preserving the original file.

By the end of the exercise, you should have:
-- one created in ./finding_files called 84_file_for_bz
and
-- one redirected to the current directory named 84.bz2
and the original file.

A17
bzip2 --keep ./finding_files/84_file_for_bzip.txt > 84.bz2

Then delete both created files.

Q18
Create a tar archive tmp_90_logs.tar (under the current directory) of the ./finding_files/90_create_tar_from_this_log directory.

A18
tar -cf tmp_90_logs.tar ./finding_files/90_create_tar_from_this_log

rm tmp_90_logs.tar

Q19
Create a newtar.tar archive of ./finding_files/82_simple_txtfile.txt in the current location.

A19
tar -cf newtar.tar ./finding_files/82_simple_txtfile.txt

Q20
Create a hidden text file named hidden.txt first.

Then list hidden files in the directory.

A20
touch .hidden_textfile

ls -la
After checking, delete the hidden text file.

Q21
Create a compressed tar archive 90logs.tar.gz of the ./finding_files/90_create_tar_from_this_log directory.

A21
tar -czf 90logs.tar.gz ./finding_files/90_create_tar_from_this_log

The dash in front of czf is not necessary.
Then remove the created file: 90logs.tar.gz

Q22
Copy the file to the current location:
cp ./finding_files/81_txt_to_gzip_cp_first.txt ./

Create a gzip archive of that copied file in the current directory.

A22
gzip 81_txt_to_gzip_cp_first.txt

Then delete this file.

Q23
Copy ./finding_files/canda_exercise to ./tmp_files_copied_for_practice/canda_exercise_tmp.

Replace "canda" with "canada" in the text file called canda_exercise_tmp.

Then check and remove the file.

A23
sed -i 's/canda/canada/g' ./tmp_files_copied_for_practice/canda_exercise_tmp

cat ./tmp_files_copied_for_practice/canda_exercise_tmp
rm ./tmp_files_copied_for_practice/canda_exercise_tmp

(The g is for global search and replace.)

Q24
Copy ./finding_files/95_enabled_disabled to ./tmp_files_copied_for_practice/95_tmp.

Change all values "enabled" to "disabled" in the ./tmp_files_copied_for_practice/95_tmp config file.

Then check the file.

A24
sed -i 's/enabled/disabled/g' ./tmp_files_copied_for_practice/95_tmp

cat ./tmp_files_copied_for_practice/95_tmp

Q25
Copy ./finding_files/94_enabled_disabled to ./tmp_files_copied_for_practice/94_tmp.

While ignoring case sensitivity, change all values "disabled" to "enabled" in the ./tmp_files_copied_for_practice/94_tmp.

For example, strings like "disabled," "DISABLED," "Disabled," etc., must match and should be replaced.

A25
sed -i 's/disabled/enabled/gi' ./tmp_files_copied_for_practice/94_tmp

cat ./tmp_files_copied_for_practice/94_tmp

rm ./tmp_files_copied_for_practice/94_tmp
